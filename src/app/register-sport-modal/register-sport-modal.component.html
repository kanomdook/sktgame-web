<div class="modal-body"> Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated
  they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows
  by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of
  sentences fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic
  life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.
